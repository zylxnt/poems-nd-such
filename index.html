                            Utopias we'd build, in a scope so wide in range.
                            Yet education holds the power, don't you see?
                            To cultivate minds for a brighter destiny.

                            Money, a human invention's reign,
                            From politics to borders, they all interplay.
                            The products of our thoughts and intention,
                            Bringing both hope and dissent, beyond convention.

                            When we teach conformity, the herd mentality,
                            Selfishness prevails, driving brutality.
                            In this bleak future, our existence may die,
                            Like parasites in a Petri dish, we'll say goodbye.

                            In the pursuit of fortune and fame, we find,
                            A world where desires and greed can blind.
                            As we chase after more, our values decay,
                            Our path grows uncertain, led astray.

                            But our future is bleak, humanity at stake,
                            As money's the game that we all partake.
                            We're parasites in a Petri dish, hearts gone cold,
                            Like mold on a surface, till our story's told.`;

                            The weight of darkness, a relentless tide,
                            Yet an ember of hope, deep down inside.

                            I yearn to escape this relentless fight,
                            To find a haven in the endless night,
                            But fear whispers softly, 'What if you stay?'
                            To share your burden and find your way.

                            The battle within, a silent plea,
                            A plea for those who can set me free,
                            To hold my hand, to lend their light,
                            And guide me through the darkest night.

                            Invisible chains, they keep me here,
                            Their weight too heavy, their presence clear.
                            A prison of thoughts, self-doubt's cruel domain,
                            Invisible but unyielding, they cause such pain.

                            Yet I hold tight to this fragile thread,
                            Hoping for rescue from the darkness, I dread.
                            In the depths of despair, I long to find,
                            A way to heal my wounded mind.`;

                            It weaves itself into the tapestry of your existence,
                            A part of life's complex and intricate persistence.

                            With time, it doesn't vanish, nor simply disappear,
                            It's a constant companion, forever near.
                            Your life grows around it, a tree's roots embrace the earth,
                            In the depths of your being, grief finds its rebirth.

                            Though the pain may lessen, the tears may subside,
                            Grief becomes a part of you, where emotions collide.
                            It shapes your perspective, colors the world you see,

                            Conceal the fears that dwell inside.

                            In beauty's mask, I try to hide,
                            A secret fear, I can't abide.
                            To live's a dance, to death, we glide,
                            In both, I seek what's locked inside.

                            Yet yearning whispers where I don't belong.

                            Repetition's grip, a subtle strain,

                            The echoes of routine, a deafening sound,
                            In stagnant waters, dreams are drowned.

                            I pivot and turn, attempting flight,
                            Seeking a shift in the fading light.
                            But alas, the rhythm persists,
                            A tireless waltz, a mind that insists.

                            Round and round, the seasons blend,
                            In circles unbroken, the mind to mend.
                            For change eludes this scripted trance,

                            Time, a renegade, dances freely, unhinged and untamed,
                            Creating a world that seems a twisted nightmare, unnamed.

                            Illusion and mirage intertwine, a freaky masquerade,
                            Every moment warps and weaves, in a dance of shades.
                            The routine, a haunting echo, a relentless, twisted song,
                            A never-ending cycle, where chaos seems to belong.

                            Trapped within this nightmare, or a dance of pure madness?
                            The lines blur, reality and illusion in a chaotic gladness.

                            Days unfold like chapters in a tale surreal,
                            A symphony of disarray, an enigma I feel.
                            In this carnival of mayhem, where sanity's unmet,
                            I question the nature of existence, a perpetual vignette.

                            Is life a mirror, reflecting a warped design?
                            Or am I entwined in a dance, where reality entwines?
                            The clock ticks, the dance continues, a mesmerizing trance,

            A night of Halloween, a dreamlike theme.
            Ghosts and goblins, a playful scene,
            Trick or treat, in costumes, we convene.

            Jack-o'-lanterns, their grins so bright,
            Guide our way through the dark of night.
            Witches brew potions, a spectral spell,
            Halloween's magic, where enchantments dwell.

            In this world of mystery and delight,
            Halloween's eve, a wondrous sight,
            Celebrate the enchantment, let it be seen,
            On this special night of Halloween.

            HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!
