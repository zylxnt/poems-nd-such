                            with grasses swaying above in mirth,
                            where silence is the only sound,
                            no yesterday, no morrow to be found.

                            to forget the weight of passing time,
                            to forget the trials of this life's climb,
                            in peaceful slumber, I'd be released,
                            in death's embrace, I'd find my peace`;

                            In a world ripe with prospects for change,
                            Utopias we'd build, in a scope so wide in range.
                            Yet education holds the power, don't you see?
                            To cultivate minds for a brighter destiny.

                            Money, a human invention's reign,
                            From politics to borders, they all interplay.
                            The products of our thoughts and intention,
                            Bringing both hope and dissent, beyond convention.

                            When we teach conformity, the herd mentality,
                            Selfishness prevails, driving brutality.
                            In this bleak future, our existence may die,
                            Like parasites in a Petri dish, we'll say goodbye.

                            In the pursuit of fortune and fame, we find,
                            A world where desires and greed can blind.
                            As we chase after more, our values decay,
                            Our path grows uncertain, led astray.

                            But our future is bleak, humanity at stake,
                            As money's the game that we all partake.
                            We're parasites in a Petri dish, hearts gone cold,
                            Like mold on a surface, till our story's told.`;

                            In the depths of despair, I long to flee,
                            But fear binds me, for all to see.
                            The weight of darkness, a relentless tide,
                            Yet an ember of hope, deep down inside.

                            I yearn to escape this relentless fight,
                            To find a haven in the endless night,
                            But fear whispers softly, 'What if you stay?'
                            To share your burden and find your way.

                            The battle within, a silent plea,
                            A plea for those who can set me free,
                            To hold my hand, to lend their light,
                            And guide me through the darkest night.

                            Invisible chains, they keep me here,
                            Their weight too heavy, their presence clear.
                            A prison of thoughts, self-doubt's cruel domain,
                            Invisible but unyielding, they cause such pain.

                            Yet I hold tight to this fragile thread,
                            Hoping for rescue from the darkness, I dread.
                            In the depths of despair, I long to find,
                            A way to heal my wounded mind.`;

                            In a whirlwind of emotion, I was once embraced,
                            A cup filled to the top, in feelings I was encased.
                            But when it overflowed, my heart's relentless tide,
                            I found myself adrift, with emotions cast aside.

                            In that maelstrom of sentiment, I soared high and low,
                            A rollercoaster of feelings, a captivating show.
                            But as the tempest raged and emotions did abate,
                            I drifted in the void, my soul's uncertain fate.

                            Gone was the happiness, vanished the sorrow,
                            Anger and despair, I could no longer borrow.
                            In the void's silent grip, I silently dwell,
                            A hollow shell, where once emotions used to swell.

                            Within this quiet void, my thoughts take flight,
                            A landscape of contemplation, in the still of the night.
                            Masked emotions play their part, a charade I play so well,
                            Hiding the emptiness, as I navigate this spell.`;
